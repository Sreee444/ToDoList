# To-Do List with Dark Mode

This is a simple and interactive **To-Do List** web application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The app also lets users set task due dates and visually prioritizes tasks based on the selected due date (overdue tasks are highlighted). Additionally, the app features a **dark mode toggle**, **random inspirational quotes**, and an attractive **user interface**.

## Features

- **Edit Tasks**: Modify any task at any time using the pencil icon next to the task.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list by clicking the trash icon.
- **Complete Tasks**: Tasks can be marked as complete by clicking the checkmark button. Completed tasks will have a line-through and a greenish background.

### Task Prioritization
- **Set Due Dates**: Users can set a due date for each task using the date picker. 
- **Color-coded Tasks**: Tasks will change color based on the due date:
  - **Overdue tasks** will have a light red background.
  - **Upcoming tasks** will have a light green background.
  
### Dark Mode
